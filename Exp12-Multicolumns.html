        <p>Fieldworkers form the backbone of India nonprofit sector. According to a 2014 report by the Ministry of
             Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), civil society organisations (CSOs) account for
              more than 27 lakh jobs and 34 lakh full-time volunteers, a majority of whom are engaged as fieldworkers across the country.
            These fieldworkers are exposed to a wide range of environmentsâ€”from highly dense urban areas to 
            virtually uninhabited rural areas. They often handle a large number of community relationships, 
            manage delicate government associations, transfer on-the-ground insights to their own teams and external stakeholders,
             and act as first responders for the communities.   
            While the importance of their role cannot be overstated, the challenges of fieldworkers are often poorly understood,
             and documented even less, especially from their perspective. In this article, we look at what can be done 
             to unlock the true effectiveness and potential of fieldworkers in order to further the impact of their work while enabling greater worklife balance.
           We conducted a study focused on the productivity of fieldworkers by reaching out to 40 fieldworkers to better understand their struggles.
